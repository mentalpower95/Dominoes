# Dominoes
 
### RULES

The game begins with a tile being placed at the center of the table. Each player then takes turns matching numbers. If a player is unable to make a match, or as the terminology goes, “extending the line”, then they are required to draw from the boneyard.

The game continues until a player manages to clear his/her hand of tiles.

### HOW TO PLAY

**Positive number [from 1 to 6]** = placing chosen domino piece at the end of the line

**Negative number [from -1 to -6]** = placing chosen domino piece at the begging of the line

**Zero [0]** = drawing new domino piece from stack
